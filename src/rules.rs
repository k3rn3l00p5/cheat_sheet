// Ownership Rules
/// Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner
/// There can only be one owner at a time
/// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

// References Rules
/// At any given time, you can either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references
/// References must always be valid

// & are references and * are dereferences
